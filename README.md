# World Anvil RPG Blocks

## Overview

This repo contains the templates used to support the Star Wars 5e (full D&D conversion) RPG system on World Anvil. These are still a work in progress, but include some useful snippets that other developers might be able to leverage.

## Structure

The repo is separated into folders for each Block Template in the Sw5e system. Within those folders are separate HTML files for each different form type.

* **Basic** - This is the default display mode that shows an existing block.
* **Edit** - This form allows for creation/editing of blocks.
* **Tracking** - This tracking form is used for live edits during a session or on the Heroes sheet.

There is also a *common* folder that contains the style sheets (in .scss formats which can be converted to CSS using the command `npm run sass:build` or `yarn run sass:build`) as well as common macros etc that are useful in many sheets.

## Credits

These templates build off of the work that Dimitris (founder of WorldAnvil) and Galiphile (author of the Star Wars 5e conversion). They both have put their sweat and tears into creating something awesome.
